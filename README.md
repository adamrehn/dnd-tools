# D&D Tools

Fan-made tools for playing the [Dungeons and Dragons](http://dnd.wizards.com/) tabletop game:

- **powercards** - a browser-based tool for managing and viewing Power Cards. Unlike [other tools](http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/13628/what-happened-to-the-dd-power-cards/13629#13629) designed for this purpose, this tool can be run either from the local filesystem (disabling server-based functionality) or hosted on your own web server.
